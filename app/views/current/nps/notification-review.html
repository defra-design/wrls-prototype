              Dear licence holder,
            </p>

            <p>
              We need to enforce the hands off flow condition of your licences because river levels are very low.
            </p>

            <p>
              <!-- as I understand it we have H1s to show bold links, if we can H3s are probably better than H1s -->

                Why you are receiving this notification
              </h3>
              You have a ‘hands off flow’ condition in your water abstraction licences. That condition authorises and restricts how much water you can abstract when the flow in the relevant watercourse has fallen below a certain level.
            </p>

            <p>
              The effect that the condition has on your abstraction is explained in your licences. You must comply with this condition and you should contact us if you are not sure how your abstraction will be affected.
            </p>

            <p>
              <h3 class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold govuk-!-margin-bottom-0">
                What happens next
              </h3><br>
              We will write to you again when the watercourse level is high enough for you to abstract without the hands off flow restriction, if the other conditions of your licences allow this.
            </p>
